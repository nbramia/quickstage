# QuickStage Development Roadmap - 

Still to do:

- Expired snapshots in the snapshots table in the dashboard should be able to be renewed by clicking the Extend Expiration clock icon - it shouldn't be hidden for expired snapshots

- I want to add another top-level item in the sidebar, at the same level as Dashboard, Projects, Settings, and Admin: Reviews. This should be a home for the Reviewer Dashboard showing reviews that have been requested on snapshots owned by the user as well as reviews that have been requested of the user by somebody else.Two different tables, two different sections, one for each.Each one should include all of the relevant actions that The user might need to make relative to those requests, including quickly navigating to the snapshot in question, Seeing review status, due dates, etc. as well as doing things like confirming that the review is complete or changing a due date.

- Add notifications related to reviews. When a user has requested a review of somebody else, and they complete that review, it should give the user who requested that review a notification. When a requested review is overdue, it should give a notification both to the person who it was requested of as well as to the person who requested it, that the due date has passed without the review being marked complete. When a review is requested of a user, it should give them a notification that someone has requested their review of something.

- I just deployed a new snapshot using version 33. I still see the comments button in the upper right allowing me to open the comments pane. It was my impression that we had implemented a full new commenting system, including things like threading comments, as well as integrating review functionality into the snapshots themselves.
This is what you told me was done, but I don't see it in the snapshot that I just created and deployed:
