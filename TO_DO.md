I'm giving you full autonomy to implement all the features marked "NOW" in the TO_DO.md file. You have complete project context and can make all necessary decisions to move forward.
- Follow guidelines in README.md and VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md. Review project holistically before starting. Read README.md again regularly.
What I expect:
- Implement all features marked "NOW" in the TO_DO.md
- Make reasonable architectural and UX decisions as you go
- Don't ask for permission - just make good choices and move forward
- Focus on the core functionality first, then add polish
- Test and deploy before committing. ONLY deploy with deploy-with-tests.sh to ensure we continue to pass tests.
- Add new tests using current testing infrastructure and approaches (including in deployment script, storing in /test with other tests), as appropriate, as you add new functionality
- Commit your work to GitHub regularly (every major feature or logical milestone)
Key areas to implement: items marked NOW in @TO_DO.md. These include:
- Snapshot Management: Project folders, naming, metadata, sortable dashboard columns
- Comments System: Element pinning, threading, rich text, file attachments
- Review Workflows: Request/check-off system, deadlines, follow-ups
- Dashboard Enhancements: Filtering, search, widgets, bulk operations
- Documentation: Interactive help, use cases, troubleshooting guides
Technical approach:
- Follow guidelines in README.md and VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md. Review project holistically before starting.
- Use the existing codebase patterns and architecture
- Leverage the current database schema where possible
- Add new database fields/tables as needed for the new features
- Maintain the existing UI/UX patterns and styling
- Ensure all new features work on both desktop and mobile
Don't worry about:
- External platform setup (Cloudflare, Slack, etc.)
- Third-party integrations that require API keys or accounts
- Features marked "LATER" or "NEXT"
Do worry about:
- Code quality and maintainability
- User experience and intuitive design
- Testing and error handling
- Performance and scalability
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

Go build something amazing! I'll review your commits and let you know if anything needs adjustment, but don't wait for feedback - keep moving forward and implementing features. When you finish one NOW item, move on to the next NOW item. It's state.
