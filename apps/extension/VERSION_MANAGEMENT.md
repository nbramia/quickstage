## üöÄ **Complete Release Workflow**

### **Step 1: Run Release Workflow**
```bash
cd apps/extension
npm run release:full
```

This command automatically:
1. Bumps the version number in `package.json`
2. Builds the extension with esbuild bundler
3. **NEW**: Cleans up old VSIX files to prevent conflicts
4. Packages it into a VSIX file with versioned filename
5. Copies the VSIX to the web app's public directory
6. Updates the web app's version information (`apps/web/src/version.ts`)
7. Updates the worker's version information (`apps/worker/src/version-info.ts`)
8. Verifies VSIX structure integrity

### **Step 2: Deploy Worker (Required for Version Updates)**
```bash
cd ../../infra
npx wrangler deploy
```

### **Step 3: Build and Deploy Web App**
```bash
cd ../apps/web
pnpm build
cd ../../infra
npx wrangler pages deploy ../apps/web/dist --project-name=quickstage
```

### **Step 4: Test the Update**
1. Visit the QuickStage dashboard
2. Check that the extension version shows as updated
3. Download the file - it should be named `quickstage-{version}.vsix`
4. Verify both primary and backup download methods work

## üîß **Manual Build Commands**

If you need to run individual steps:

```bash
cd apps/extension

# Build bundled extension
npm run build          # Runs build-bundle.js (esbuild bundler)

# Package into VSIX
npm run package        # Runs build-manual.js (manual packaging)

# Complete release workflow
npm run release:full   # Bump version ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Package ‚Üí Update Web App + Worker
```

## üß† **Enhanced Project Detection (v0.0.14+)**

### **Universal Project Support**
The extension now automatically detects and handles various project structures:

**Monorepo Detection:**
- Automatically finds web apps in `apps/*/dist`, `packages/*/dist` patterns
- Handles multiple build outputs intelligently
- Lets users choose when multiple options exist
- Perfect for complex project structures like QuickStage itself

**Static Site Detection:**
- Identifies projects with `index.html` in root directory
- Checks for CSS/JS assets to confirm complete sites
- No build process required for static projects
- Ideal for hand-built prototypes or AI-generated sites

**Framework Auto-Detection:**
- Vite: Looks for `dist/` with `index.html`
- Next.js: Checks for `out/` or `build/` with static export
- SvelteKit: Finds `.svelte-kit/output/prerendered/`
- CRA: Looks for `build/` directory
- Custom builds: Allows user-defined output locations

### **Smart Fallbacks & Error Handling**
- **Descriptive Error Messages**: Shows exactly what the extension looked for
- **Project Structure Summary**: Displays project contents for debugging
- **AI-Friendly Formatting**: Errors are formatted for easy copy-paste to AI assistants
- **Manual Selection**: Always allows users to specify output folder
- **Verification**: Checks selected folders have the right structure

## üìÅ **File Locations**

### **Extension Build Output**
- **Source**: `apps/extension/src/extension.ts`
- **Bundled**: `apps/extension/dist/extension.js`
- **VSIX Package**: `apps/extension/quickstage-{version}.vsix` (temporary)

### **Web App Integration**
- **Public VSIX**: `apps/web/public/quickstage.vsix` (generic filename)
- **Versioned VSIX**: `apps/web/public/quickstage-{version}.vsix` (cache-busting)
- **Version Info**: `apps/web/src/version.ts` (auto-generated)
- **Build Output**: `apps/web/dist/` (deployed to Cloudflare Pages)

### **Worker Integration**
- **Version Info**: `apps/worker/src/version-info.ts` (auto-generated)
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/extensions/version` and `/api/extensions/download`

## üåê **Extension Download URLs**

### **Primary Download (Web App)**
- **URL**: `https://quickstage.tech/quickstage.vsix`
- **Downloaded As**: `quickstage-{version}.vsix` (versioned filename)
- **Source**: Web app public directory
- **Caching**: Standard Cloudflare Pages caching

### **Backup Download (Worker API)**
- **URL**: `https://quickstage.tech/api/extensions/download`
- **Downloaded As**: `quickstage-{version}.vsix` (versioned filename)
- **Source**: Worker fetches from web app with explicit headers
- **Benefits**: Bypass caching issues, forced download headers

### **Version Information**
- **URL**: `https://quickstage.tech/api/extensions/version`
- **Source**: Worker API endpoint (auto-synced version)
- **Purpose**: Check for updates and version info

## üîÑ **Deployment Scenarios**

### **Extension Updates Only (v0.0.14+)**
```bash
# Now requires both worker and web app deployment for version sync
cd apps/extension && npm run release:full
cd ../../infra && npx wrangler deploy              # Deploy worker with new version
cd ../apps/web && pnpm build
cd ../../infra && npx wrangler pages deploy ../apps/web/dist --project-name=quickstage
```

### **Worker Changes (API updates, etc.)**
```bash
# Deploy worker first, then web app if needed
cd infra && npx wrangler deploy
cd ../apps/web && pnpm build
cd ../../infra && npx wrangler pages deploy ../apps/web/dist --project-name=quickstage
```

### **Full System Update**
```bash
# Update everything in correct order
cd apps/extension && npm run release:full
cd ../../infra && npx wrangler deploy              # Worker version sync
cd ../apps/web && pnpm build
cd ../../infra && npx wrangler pages deploy ../apps/web/dist --project-name=quickstage
```

### **Routing Fixes (NEW - 2025-01-27)**
For critical routing issues like `/s/*` not working:

```bash
# Use the automated deployment script (RECOMMENDED)
./deploy-fix.sh

# Or manual deployment:
cd apps/web && pnpm build                          # Build with routing fixes
cd ../../infra && npx wrangler deploy              # Deploy worker first
cd ../apps/web && pnpm build                       # Build web app
cd ../../infra && npx wrangler pages deploy ../apps/web/dist --project-name=quickstage
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **VSIX Not Found After Release**
- Check that `apps/web/public/` directory exists
- Verify VSIX was copied successfully
- Ensure web app build includes public directory

### **Version Mismatch**
- Run `npm run release:full` again to sync versions
- Check `apps/web/src/version.ts` is up to date
- **NEW**: Check `apps/worker/src/version-info.ts` is up to date
- Verify both worker and web app deployments were successful

### **Extension Download Fails**
- Try the backup download URL: `/api/extensions/download`
- Check Cloudflare Pages deployment status
- Verify `/quickstage.vsix` is accessible
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify file downloads with correct versioned filename

### **Downloaded File Issues**
- Ensure downloaded file is named `quickstage-{version}.vsix`
- Compare downloaded file size with local VSIX (should be ~6-7KB)
- Try both download methods: primary (web app) and backup (API)

### **/s/* Routing Issues (RESOLVED - 2025-08-21)**
**Critical Issue**: Users see QuickStage dashboard instead of staged snapshots

**Symptoms**:
- Staging works (extension generates URLs)
- Worker logs show no `/s/*` requests
- Users see "No snapshot ID provided" or blank content
- Cloudflare Pages serves React app instead of proxying to Worker

**Root Cause**: Cloudflare Pages routing complexity and configuration issues

**Solution**: Direct Worker approach implemented

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Extension generates working URLs**: `https://quickstage-worker.nbramia.workers.dev/s/abc123`
- ‚úÖ **Comments system working**: No more 404 errors
- ‚úÖ **Password protection working**: Secure access control
- ‚úÖ **Asset loading working**: CSS/JS files load correctly

**Benefits of Current Approach**:
- **100% reliability**: No routing failures
- **Simpler architecture**: Direct Worker access
- **Faster response**: No proxy layers
- **Easier debugging**: Clear request flow

**Testing**:
- Stage new project: Should generate working URLs
- Visit generated URL: Should show password prompt
- Enter password: Should show prototype with comments button
- Test comments: Should work without 404 errors

### **VSIX Installation Errors**

#### **"Extract: extension/package.json not found inside zip"**
This error occurs when the VSIX package structure is incorrect. The issue was fixed in v0.0.8:

**Problem**: The original `package.json` had `"main": "dist/extension.js"`, but the VSIX package structure was:
```
quickstage-0.0.6.vsix
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.js          # Bundled extension
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # Manifest pointing to "dist/extension.js" (wrong path)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
```

**Solution**: The VSIX package now has the correct structure:
```
quickstage-0.0.8.vsix
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.js          # Bundled extension (in package root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # Manifest pointing to "extension.js" (correct path)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
```

**How to Avoid**: The `build-manual.js` script now:
1. Copies `dist/extension.js` to the package root as `extension.js`
2. Creates a new `package.json` with `"main": "extension.js"`
3. Uses the `archiver` library instead of the `zip` command for reliable packaging
4. Ensures the VSIX structure matches VS Code's expectations

#### **"Cannot find module" Errors**
- Ensure you're using `npm run build` (esbuild bundler) not `tsc`
- Check that all dependencies are properly bundled
- Verify the bundled `extension.js` contains all required code

## üî¢ **Version Management & Incrementing (NEW - 2025-08-21)**

### **Automatic Version Incrementing**
Every release now automatically increments the version number to ensure unique VSIX filenames:

**How It Works:**
1. **Automatic Bumping**: `npm run release:full` runs `version:bump.js` first
2. **Patch Increment**: Version goes from `0.0.29` ‚Üí `0.0.30` ‚Üí `0.0.31`
3. **Unique Filenames**: Each release creates `quickstage-{version}.vsix`
4. **Cache Busting**: Both generic and versioned filenames are served

**Version Bump Process:**
```bash
# Before: version 0.0.29
npm run release:full

# During: version automatically bumped to 0.0.30
# Creates: quickstage-0.0.30.vsix

# Next run: version automatically bumped to 0.0.31
# Creates: quickstage-0.0.31.vsix
```

**Benefits:**
- **No More Duplicate Downloads**: Each version has a unique filename
- **Automatic Updates**: Users always get the latest version
- **Version Tracking**: Clear history of all releases
- **Cache Busting**: Browsers download new versions immediately

## üõ†Ô∏è **Current System Architecture (NEW - 2025-08-21)**

### **Direct Worker Approach for Maximum Reliability**
QuickStage now uses a simplified, reliable architecture that prioritizes functionality:

**Current Architecture:**
1. **Extension generates URLs**: Directly to `https://quickstage-worker.nbramia.workers.dev/s/abc123`
2. **No Pages routing complexity**: Bypasses Cloudflare Pages routing issues
3. **Direct Worker access**: Ensures 100% reliability for snapshot serving
4. **Simplified deployment**: Fewer moving parts, easier to maintain

**Why This Approach:**
- **Reliability**: No routing failures or proxy issues
- **Performance**: Direct access without additional layers
- **Debugging**: Clear request flow for troubleshooting
- **Maintenance**: Simpler architecture with fewer failure points

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **100% uptime**: No routing failures
- ‚úÖ **Faster response**: Direct Worker access
- ‚úÖ **Easier debugging**: Clear request flow
- ‚úÖ **Simpler deployment**: Fewer configuration files

## üõ†Ô∏è **Routing & Infrastructure (NEW - 2025-01-27)**

### **Multi-Layer Routing Architecture (Previous Approach)**
QuickStage previously attempted a comprehensive routing strategy to ensure reliable `/s/*` routing:

**Routing Layers**:
1. **`_redirects`**: Traditional Cloudflare Pages redirects with force flag
2. **`_routes.json`**: Modern routing configuration with explicit exclusions
3. **`_worker.js`**: Pages Worker for programmatic routing (most reliable)
4. **Pages Functions**: Backup routing method in `apps/web/functions/s/[[path]].ts`

**Why Multi-Layer?**
- Cloudflare Pages can be finicky about routing
- Different routing methods work in different scenarios
- Multiple fallbacks ensure reliability
- At least one method should work in any environment

### **Routing Configuration Files**
- **`_redirects`**: `/s/* https://quickstage-worker.nbramia.workers.dev/s/:splat 200!`
- **`_routes.json`**: Explicit routing with exclusions for `/s/*`
- **`_worker.js`**: Programmatic routing with error handling and logging
- **Pages Functions**: Backup routing with comprehensive error handling

### **Build Process Updates**
The build script now copies all routing configuration files:
```bash
"build": "tsc -b && vite build && cp -r functions dist/ && cp public/_worker.js dist/ && cp public/test-routing.html dist/"
```

### **Testing & Debugging**
- **Test File**: `test-routing.html` for debugging routing issues
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging in all routing methods
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and helpful error messages
- **Deployment Script**: `deploy-fix.sh` for automated deployment

## üí¨ **Universal Commenting System (NEW - 2025-08-21)**

### **Overview**
Every staged prototype now automatically includes a comprehensive commenting system that works regardless of the underlying framework or structure.

### **Current System Status**
