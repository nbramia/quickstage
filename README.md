## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Vite 5
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, Hono.js, TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-like tokens, Google OAuth
- **Storage**: Cloudflare KV, Cloudflare R2, Cloudflare Analytics
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages, Wrangler
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (monorepo)
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW
- **Code Organization**: Modular architecture with separated concerns

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Cloudflare account with Workers and Pages enabled
- Stripe account for billing (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nbramia/quickstage.git
cd quickstage

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Set up OpenAI API key for AI features
cd infra
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --config ../../infra/wrangler.toml
# Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

### Development

```bash
# Start all services
pnpm dev

# Start specific service
pnpm --filter @quickstage/web dev
pnpm --filter @quickstage/worker dev
pnpm --filter @quickstage/extension dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Testing Requirements

**Before ANY deployment, AI agents MUST run tests:**

```bash
# Quick validation (5 seconds)
npm run test:quick

# Core functionality (1-2 minutes)  
npm run test:core

# Automated FULL-STACK deployment with testing
./deploy-with-tests.sh
```

**This script automatically:**
- âœ… Runs all tests for both worker and web app
- âœ… Deploys the backend worker to Cloudflare Workers
- âœ… Deploys the frontend web app to Cloudflare Pages
- âœ… Verifies both deployments are successful

**Failure to test will result in broken deployments.**
```

### Clean URL Configuration

QuickStage now uses clean URLs for all snapshots and API endpoints:
- Snapshots: `quickstage.tech/s/{id}` (instead of worker subdomain)
- All API calls route directly through the main domain
- Centralized configuration in `apps/web/src/config.ts`

### Deployment

```bash
# ðŸš€ RECOMMENDED: Full-stack deployment with testing
./deploy-with-tests.sh

# Alternative: Deploy specific service (if needed)
pnpm --filter @quickstage/worker deploy
pnpm --filter @quickstage/web deploy
```

**Note:** The `deploy-with-tests.sh` script handles both worker and web app deployment automatically, ensuring all tests pass before deployment.

## ðŸ¤– AI UX Assistant

QuickStage includes a powerful AI assistant that analyzes your prototypes and provides expert UI/UX feedback. Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, it offers conversational, contextual suggestions to improve your designs.

### Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: AI analyzes your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to understand your design
- **Conversational Interface**: Chat with the AI to ask specific questions about your prototype
- **Expert Feedback**: Get suggestions based on modern UI/UX principles, accessibility guidelines, and design best practices
- **Multiple Categories**: Feedback covers accessibility, usability, design, performance, and mobile responsiveness
- **Rate Limited**: Smart rate limiting (40 requests/hour, 100K tokens/hour) to prevent abuse
- **Anonymous Access**: Works for both signed-in users and anonymous viewers of public snapshots

### Key Areas of Analysis

- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation
- **Visual Design**: Typography hierarchy, color contrast, spacing consistency
- **Mobile UX**: Responsive design, touch targets, mobile-first considerations
- **Usability**: Navigation flow, error handling, loading states, user feedback
- **Performance**: Image optimization, code efficiency, loading patterns
- **Modern Standards**: Latest design trends and best practices

### How It Works

1. **Click "AI UX Assistant"** in any snapshot viewer
2. **Start Analysis**: AI reads your prototype files and provides initial feedback
3. **Ask Questions**: Continue the conversation with specific questions like:
   - "How can I improve accessibility for screen readers?"
   - "What's the best way to organize this navigation?"
   - "Is this color scheme accessible?"
   - "How can I make this more mobile-friendly?"

### Rate Limiting & Error Handling

- **User Limits**: 40 AI requests per hour per user/IP
- **Token Limits**: 100,000 tokens per hour to manage OpenAI costs
- **Conversation Limits**: 20 messages per conversation (24-hour expiry)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages when service is unavailable
- **Privacy**: User-friendly error messages (doesn't expose API funding issues)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Enhanced error handling for MutationObserver and iframe-related issues
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry functionality with user-friendly error messages
- **DOM Safety**: Proper null checks and timing delays to prevent browser compatibility issues

### Configuration

The AI assistant requires an OpenAI API key to be configured:

```bash
# Add your OpenAI API key to Cloudflare Workers secrets
cd infra
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --config ../../infra/wrangler.toml
```

**API Documentation**: [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)

### Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: `/api/snapshots/:id/ai-chat/` endpoints in Cloudflare Workers
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini for fast, cost-effective responses
- **Storage**: Conversations stored in Cloudflare KV with automatic expiry
- **Frontend**: Real-time chat interface with markdown-like formatting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures, rate limits, and browser compatibility issues
- **DOM Safety**: Enhanced iframe handling with proper timing and null checks
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed requests

## ðŸ’¬ Enhanced Comment System

QuickStage features a professional-grade comment system that rivals tools like Figma, Notion, and other collaborative platforms. The system supports threaded discussions, visual element pinning, and comprehensive state management.

### Comment Features

## Code Architecture

The QuickStage codebase has been refactored for maintainability and scalability:

### **Modular Worker Structure**
- **`index.ts`** (4,659 lines): Main entry point with all API routes
- **`auth.ts`**: Authentication utilities (session, PAT, superadmin checks)
- **`user.ts`**: User management (creation, subscription, trial logic)
- **`stripe.ts`**: Stripe webhook handlers (payments, subscriptions)
- **`snapshot.ts`**: Snapshot management (view counting, cleanup)
- **`analytics.ts`**: Analytics tracking and event management
- **`migrate-schema.ts`**: Schema migration helpers
- **`migration-system.ts`**: Data migration system
- **`worker-utils.ts`**: Shared worker utilities

### **Benefits of Refactoring**
- **Reduced Complexity**: Main file reduced from 5,217 to 4,659 lines (11% smaller)
- **Better Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Easier Testing**: Modules can be tested independently
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
- **Code Reuse**: Modules can be imported where needed
- **Future Growth**: Easy to add new features without bloating main file
